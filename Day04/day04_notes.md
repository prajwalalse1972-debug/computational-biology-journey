# Day 04 – Transcription & RNA as Data

## What is transcription?
Transcription is the process by which a cell copies a gene’s DNA sequence into messenger RNA (mRNA).  
This RNA carries genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis.

## How is RNA different from DNA?
- RNA is single-stranded, while DNA is double-stranded
- RNA contains ribose sugar, DNA contains deoxyribose
- RNA uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T)
- RNA is shorter and less stable than DNA

---

## Why is RNA important?
- mRNA delivers genetic information to ribosomes for protein synthesis
- tRNA supplies amino acids during translation
- RNA plays regulatory roles in gene expression
- Some viruses use RNA as genetic material
- Certain RNAs act as ribozymes and catalyze reactions

## Key takeaway
Transcription is a biological data transformation where DNA information is converted into RNA, which can be analyzed computationally.
