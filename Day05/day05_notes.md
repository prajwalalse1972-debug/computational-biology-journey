# Day 05 – Translation & Codons

## What is translation?
Translation is the process of synthesizing proteins using the genetic information encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA).

---

## What is a codon?
A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides (bases) in mRNA that corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal during protein synthesis.

---

## Why are codons groups of three bases?
- RNA has four different nucleotides: A, U, G, and C
- Cells need to code for 20 different amino acids
- Using triplets gives 4³ = 64 possible codons
- This provides redundancy, meaning multiple codons can code for the same amino acid

---

## Key takeaway
Translation works by reading mRNA in triplets (codons), starting with a start codon (AUG) and ending at a stop codon, to build proteins.
