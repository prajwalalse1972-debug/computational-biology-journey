# Day 03 – GC Content & DNA Validation

## What is GC content?
GC content is the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases present in a DNA sequence.

GC% = (G + C) / (A + T + G + C) × 100

In computational biology, GC content is calculated programmatically using nucleotide counts.

## Why is GC content biologically important?
- High GC content makes DNA more stable due to stronger hydrogen bonding
- Low GC content allows DNA to melt more easily
- GC content varies across:
  - Different species
  - Different genomic regions
  - Coding vs non-coding DNA

---

## Why is GC content useful computationally?
GC content is commonly used for:
- Genome comparison
- Gene prediction
- Primer design
- Sequence quality checks

---

## Key takeaway
DNA sequences can be validated and analyzed computationally, and GC content serves as an important numerical feature linking biological stability with computational analysis.
