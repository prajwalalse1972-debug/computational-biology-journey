# Day 11 – Protein Molecular Weight & Charge Analysis

## 1️⃣ Why is molecular weight important?

Molecular weight (MW) is a key physical property of proteins.

- It helps confirm protein identity by comparing experimental results with theoretical sequence-based calculations.
- It is fundamental for laboratory techniques such as:
  - SDS-PAGE (electrophoresis)
  - Size-exclusion chromatography
  - Mass spectrometry
- It influences diffusion rate and purification behavior.

## 2️⃣ Why does acidic/basic composition affect protein behavior?

The ratio of acidic to basic amino acids determines a protein’s net charge at a given pH.

- Acidic residues (D, E) → negatively charged
- Basic residues (K, R, H) → positively charged

### Biological implications:

- **Solubility**:  
  Proteins with similar charges repel each other and remain dissolved.  
  When charges balance, aggregation becomes more likely.

- **Molecular interactions**:  
  Basic proteins often bind to negatively charged DNA.

- **Protein folding**:  
  Electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) help stabilize 3D structure.

## 3️⃣ Why is the isoelectric point (pI) biologically important?

The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which a protein has zero net charge.

- At its pI, a protein is usually least soluble and more likely to aggregate.
- Cells maintain internal pH away from a protein’s pI to keep it stable and functional.
- pI often reflects the environment where a protein functions.

## 🔬 Key Takeaway

By analyzing molecular weight and amino acid charge composition, we can:

- Estimate protein size
- Infer likely charge behavior
- Predict interaction tendencies
- Connect sequence to biochemical properties
