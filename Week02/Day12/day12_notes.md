# Day 12 – Hydrophobicity Analysis & Membrane Prediction

## 1️⃣ Why do membrane proteins have high hydrophobic content?

Membrane proteins must interact with the non-polar interior of the phospholipid bilayer.

- The fatty acid tails of membrane lipids are hydrophobic.
- Transmembrane regions therefore contain long stretches of non-polar amino acids.
- Hydrophobic residues allow thermodynamic stability inside the lipid environment.
- Without sufficient hydrophobic residues, the protein would be energetically unfavorable within the membrane.

## 2️⃣ How does hydrophobicity affect protein folding?

Hydrophobicity is one of the primary driving forces of protein folding.

- **Hydrophobic collapse**: Non-polar side chains cluster together to avoid water.
- **Core formation**: Proteins often form a dense hydrophobic core in the center.
- Hydrophilic residues remain exposed on the surface to interact with water.
- This arrangement stabilizes the protein’s 3D structure.

## 3️⃣ Why are soluble enzymes often hydrophilic?

Soluble proteins must remain dissolved in aqueous environments such as cytoplasm or blood.

- Hydrophilic surfaces allow interaction with water.
- Charged and polar residues prevent aggregation.
- While the surface is typically hydrophilic, active sites may contain hydrophobic pockets for specific substrate binding.

## 🔬 Key Takeaway

Hydrophobicity analysis allows us to:

- Predict membrane-associated proteins
- Infer folding behavior
- Estimate solubility
- Connect amino acid composition to structural biology

This represents an important step in computational protein profiling.
