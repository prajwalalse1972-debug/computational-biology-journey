# Day 07 – Open Reading Frame (ORF) Detection

## What defines the start of an ORF?
The start of an ORF is defined by a start codon, most commonly AUG, which signals the initiation of translation and usually codes for methionine.

---

## What defines the end of an ORF?
The end of an ORF is defined by an in-frame stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), which signals the ribosome to terminate translation and release the newly synthesized polypeptide.

---

## Why must the start and stop codons be in the same frame?
Start and stop codons must be in the same reading frame to ensure that the genetic message is translated into the correct sequence of amino acids. A shift in frame alters codon grouping and leads to incorrect or truncated proteins.

---

## Key takeaway
An ORF represents a biologically meaningful region of RNA that can potentially be translated into a protein and must be detected using frame-aware computational logic.
