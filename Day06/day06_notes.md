# Day 06 – Reading Frames & Open Reading Frames (ORFs)

## What is a reading frame?
A reading frame refers to how ribosomes read mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction by grouping nucleotides into codons.  
On a single RNA strand, translation can begin at any of the first three nucleotides, resulting in three possible reading frames.

## What is an Open Reading Frame (ORF)?
An ORF is a sequence that starts with a start codon (usually AUG) and ends at the first in-frame stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), with no intervening stop codons, and can potentially be translated into a protein.

---

## Why are there three reading frames?
- RNA does not contain fixed punctuation between codons
- Shifting the starting nucleotide by one or two bases creates different codon groupings
- Only the correct frame, selected by ribosomal scanning and start codon context, produces the correct protein
- Other frames usually encounter stop codons quickly

---

## Why don’t all AUG codons produce proteins?
Although AUG codes for methionine, translation initiation depends on sequence context:
- Kozak sequence in eukaryotes
- Shine–Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes

Only AUG codons in the correct context initiate translation.

## Key takeaway
Protein synthesis depends not just on codons, but on the correct reading frame and biological context, which must be considered in computational analysis.
